# Storybook Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate storybook setup with React and Typescript

## Usage

Clone or download the repo to get started, then run

```
yarn install
```

Once that is completed you can get the local setup running with

```
yarn start
```

And to build a deployable version to `/docs` file run:

```
yarn build
```

You can [see the current built version here](https://lubna.github.io/storybook-react-typescript-boilerplate)

The boilerplate has a test component and only the basic setup. You can add plugins and themes to further customise storybook to your liking.

[Take a look at the storybook docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/) to learn more about the tool.
